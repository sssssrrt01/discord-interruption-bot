## Downloading and Running
1. Download the repo and put your desired audio file in the same directory as ``index.js`` with the name ``audio.mp3``. 

2. Install required node modules with this command:
```
npm i
```

3. Next, add your bot token to ``index.js`` by filling in the ``token`` variable.

4. Finally, run ``node index.js`` and use the command ``!troll [user id]``  in your Discord server! The bot will DM you with information, so make sure your DMs are open
